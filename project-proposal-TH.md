**The Big Idea**
The main idea of our project is to explore the inner workings of a search engine. This will be created from scratch with the hopes of optimizing the time it takes to find specific material related to the course. One example of this would be to seach for for loops. The search engine would return all the course notes related to for loops. 
Our stretch goal would be to create this search engine in hopes of innovating the ways students search for course related notes. Our minimum viable product would be to create a search engine which actually works. 


**Learning Goals**
Learning Goals for this capstone project would be to effectively build a search engine. Communication and team participation will need to be at an all time high to effectively meet our end goal. 
Luckily, through our previous courses we have lots of experience with this. ON an induvidual note, my goal is to contribute to the team as best as I can in a clear and concise manor.


**Implementation Plan**
    Since we are at the initial stages of our capstone project, we have not come up with a concrete plan to implement the completion of the project. 
Our first step is to hold a team meeting where we weill all go over our strengths and weaknesses to see how it applies to the goal of the project. From that point on we will delegate tasks and establish team check-ins to continue to monitor progress.


**Project Schedule**
    Our Project schedule has not currently been defined. However, this weekend we will look to set up a timeline. We hope to complete 50% of the code at the end of the next 4 weeks.



**Collaboration**
    While there is no concrete collaboration plan currently in place, our team will first map out what exatcly needs to be done in order to fulfill the project requrements for building a search engine.
    From that point on, we will delegate roles as it relates to certain tasks in the process of completing the code. 
    Most likely, we will form partnerships which consisgt of team members so that the group holds one another accountable for all the work that will need to be completed.
    Bi-weekly check-ins will most likely occur as this is the most efficient way to manage such a large workload. 



**Risks**
    The biggest risk will be that our team will be unable to complete a properly working search engine as it relates to finding relevant courseowrk. This is an extremely challenging task,
    however we believe that with the tools available to us our group should be able to accomplish the goal we have set for ourselves. 


**Additional**
    There is nothing I believe that needs to be added to the course, however I would like to see a more in-depth look at things we have already looked at including conditional statements and iterations.
